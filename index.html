                        <p id="pStart">I'm an aspiring web/software developer, learned some of the basics on my own and took a few courses to
                            further my knowledge. Most of my IT knowledge was hardware and break/fix work, aside from typical tier 2 helpdesk
                            work. I've learned a bit of Javascript, Java, CSS, HTML, Ruby, and JQuery.
                        </p>

                        <p id="pStart2"> My passion for development came from first started from working with computer hardware, I ended up getting into game design
                            and wanted to teach myself how to code. I reached out to my aunt who runs her own web development business and asked for resources
                            to learn and she helped me find my way. Now I'm taking currently taking courses to further advance my abilities and hopefully open
                            the door to getting my foot in the industry.
                        </p>

                        <p id="pStart3"> Aside from development, my major hobbies would include, reading, graphic design, football, basketball, working out, and working on cars. I spent about the first
                        10 years of my life playing sports. Aside from that, I worked doing graphic design during high school and transfered to working on cars afterwards.
